                    <p>TeacherGoods is a non-profit service for public school teachers committed to helping teachers get the classroom supplies they need throughout the school year and to help all members of the community reduce waste from excess school supplies. 
                    <br><br>
                    Teachers all over the country spend anywhere from a couple hundred dollars to over a thousand dollars out of their own pockets each year buying classroom supplies to create an effective, conducive learning environment for their students. These supplies include not only classroom materials, but also school supplies for less fortunate students when they need them. As teachers who care for their students' education, the money is willingly spent. Nonetheless, the out-of-pocket costs for teachers are a significant burden on their already stringent budget.
                    <br><br>
                    Parents and their children generally spend less than $250 a year on school supplies, and often times they are purchasing new supplies each year. But, at the end of each year, students often have school supplies left over, unused, untouched, or barely used. Many times, a notebook will have five used pages and the rest is brand new - but won't be used again. These supplies are wasted, collecting dust in a closet, basement, or garage, when they could be used again.
                    <br><br>
                    TeacherGoods solves problems for both teachers and parents. With our service, teachers throughout the year can list materials and supplies they are in need of, and members of the community can check these lists and donate items that they don't need. Students can use this service to actively contribute to their classroom throughout the year as well. With TeacherGoods, your community can become actively involved in helping schools flourish, by allowing teachers to focus on investing quality teaching strategies in their students without the simple limitation of materials. </p>

                    <p class="text-center">Based on a survey done in 2011 by Ethical Ocean, only 45% of the population buys new school supplies because they are absolutely required to. Eighty-two percent (82%) buy new supplies because of value - in other words, they're buying new supplies in bulk and excessive quantities simply because of the huge back-to-school promotions. Thirty percent (30%) buy new items to replace older items they already have, and 36% buy new items because of trends, peer pressure, and/or just because they want to. That means a lot of older, still usable school supplies are left in the dust or thrown out.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, according to the National School Supply and Equipment Association (NSSEA) between 2012-2013, 99.5% of all public school teachers spent money out-of-pocket on classroom materials for their students. Teachers are spending an average of $500 to over $1000, and sometimes $2000-$5000 on classroom supplies for their students - and all of this comes out of their paychecks. And, according to the Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development (ASCD), these statistics don't vary between rural, urban, and metropolitan areas. Teachers everywhere are dedicated to student learning and success, regardless of where they are from.</p>
